PROJECT TITLE
Automated Deployment of Multi-tier WordPress Application on GKE using Terraform

STUDENT INFORMATION
Student Name : Mohd Sabir

ABSTRACT

This project focuses on establishing a comprehensive infrastructure automation and application deployment pipeline using Terraform and Google Cloud Platform (GCP). The primary objective is to provision all required GCP resources—including Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE), Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), subnets, firewall rules, and Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles—through Infrastructure as Code (IaC) using Terraform.

After provisioning the infrastructure, a multi-tier open-source application consisting of WordPress as the frontend and MySQL as the backend will be deployed on the Kubernetes cluster. The project demonstrates how DevOps principles, container orchestration, and cloud-native technologies can be integrated to achieve automated, scalable, and repeatable deployments.

Key concepts explored include containerization, Kubernetes services, persistent storage, secret management, and environment lifecycle management. This proof-of-concept highlights the reliable creation and teardown of production-like environments using Terraform scripts and Kubernetes YAML manifests.

ASSUMPTIONS / DECLARATIONS

A GCP Free Tier account will be used for all development and testing activities.

All infrastructure components such as VPC, GKE cluster, service accounts, and storage will be provisioned using Terraform.

Application components (WordPress and MySQL) will be deployed using Kubernetes manifests on the GKE cluster.

The system is developed for educational and proof-of-concept purposes and is not optimized for production-scale or high-availability workloads.

A standard development laptop running Windows or Linux will be used for development and CLI operations.

MAIN OBJECTIVES / DELIVERABLES

Automate the creation and management of GCP infrastructure using Terraform.

Deploy a multi-tier containerized WordPress application with a MySQL backend on GKE.

Implement core Kubernetes features such as Persistent Volumes, ConfigMaps, Secrets, and LoadBalancer services.

Demonstrate practical implementation of IaC and DevOps principles.

Provide complete documentation and architecture diagrams explaining the deployment workflow.
